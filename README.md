🛠️ My Process
Built With

This project was developed using only HTML and CSS, demonstrating core UI development practices:

Semantic HTML5

CSS Custom Properties (Variables)

Flexbox

CSS Grid (for complex layout areas)

Mobile-first workflow

Multiple responsive breakpoints with media queries

📘 What I Learned

Working on this challenge strengthened multiple key areas:

⭐ Advanced CSS Grid Layout

I used Grid to structure dense data components like hourly and weekly forecasts, ensuring perfect alignment and consistency across devices.

⭐ Pure CSS Interactivity

The unit toggle and day selector were styled using pseudo-classes and sibling combinators, simulating functional UI elements without JavaScript.

⭐ Responsive Design for Data-Heavy UI

Weather apps contain a lot of information. Careful spacing, sizing, and media queries were essential to maintain readability on mobile (375px) through desktop (1440px).

🔮 Continued Development

Next planned steps:

JavaScript Integration

Fetch real-time weather data

Implement search functionality

Automatic content updates

Unit conversion logic (°C ↔ °F)

Accessibility Enhancements

ARIA attributes

Improved keyboard navigation

Better focus management
